## Cartify

This is an Up'n Running Ecommerce app built with django for the backend and react for the front end 
I've worked with 3 team mates on this project on both backend and front end but for some reasone git history is not available (.git folder)
so it's one solid rock repo

 => User endpoints:                  
     1. /account               
     2. /account/update                
 => Stripe Payment Integration               
 => Images Model and uploading to free host API               
 => Root / endpoint (landing page)
