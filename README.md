## Cartify

This is an Up'n Running Ecommerce app built with django for the backend and react for the frontend.       
I've worked with 3 team mates on this project on both backend and frontend.    
But, ... for some reasons git history is not available ðŸ˜• - so this is a one solid rock repo    

What I 've worked on (Backend):
1. User endpoints authenticated with (jwt) - protected routes:
   1. /account               
   2. /account/update                
2. Stripe Payment Integration               
3. Images Model and uploading to free host API               
4. Root / endpoint (landing page)               
5. Fixing Bugs    


What I've worked on (Frontend):
1. Landing page
2. Cart page (quantity and price manipulations)
3. Payment page
4. Rendering Images
5. Fixing Bugs
