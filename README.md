## Ashion

This is an Up'n Running E-commerce app built with Django for the backend and React for the frontend.       
I've worked with 3 teammates on this project on both the backend and frontend.    
But, ... for some reason git history is not available ðŸ˜• - so this is a one solid rock repo    

What I've worked on (Backend):
1. Root / endpoint (landing page)               
2. Images Model and uploading to free host API               
3. User endpoints authenticated with (jwt) - protected routes:
   1. /account               
   2. /account/update                
4. Stripe Payment Integration               
5. Fixing Bugs    


What I've worked on (Frontend):
1. Landing page
2. Rendering Images
3. Cart page (quantity and price manipulations)
4. Payment page
5. Fixing Bugs
